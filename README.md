          * `dump` - for backup

  1. Bootstrap the buildout with Python 2.7:

     ```
     $ python bootstrap.py
     ```

  1. Build the buildout:

  1. If you havenâ€™t configured bakthat yet, you should run:

      ```
      $ bin/bakthat configure
      $ bin/bakthat configure_backups_rotation
      ```

     >Bakthat rely on the GrandFatherSon module to compute rotations, so if you need to setup more complex rotation scheme
     >(like hourly backups), refer to the docs and change the rotation settings manually in your configuration file.
